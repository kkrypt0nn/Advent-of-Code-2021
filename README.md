# Advent of Code 2021

<img src="AoC.jpg" width="75%" height="75%">

Like every year I try to participate (and not give up lol) to the yearly Advent of Code. Since I am currently learning Go I've decided this year to fully make it in Go, woohoo.

This is the first time I make my AoC repository public, therefore expect this:
- I won't smash my keyboard at 6am (my time when daily challenge is published)
- I may skip one day and do it the next day (I still have school)
- It won't be the best code but it will work (I will try to code it as good as I can)
- I might stop doing it in the middle of the month, as my brain is not big enough to even understand some challenges
